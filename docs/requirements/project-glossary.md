# Project Glossary

**Project:** _[Your project name]_
**Team:** _[Team NN]_
**Client:** _[Client name and organization]_
**Version:** 0.1

_**How to use this template.** Instructions appear in italic square brackets. Fill in underneath them and leave them in the file until the document is stable._

_**What this document is for.** Every project has words that mean something specific inside the client's organization and something else outside it, or nothing at all. This file fixes one word to one concept, and commits the team, the client, and the AI teammate to using it. That shared vocabulary is called a **ubiquitous language**: the same term in the client conversation, in the vision and scope, in the use cases, in the class names, and in the database columns._

_**Why the glossary is the first artifact you write and the last one you finish.** It is the cheapest document to start, because your client hands you the terms in the first meeting whether you ask or not, and it is the one that keeps paying: every later document cites it instead of redefining things._

## Why this matters when an agent writes your code

_[Read this once, then delete this section when the document goes stable.]_

_If two words in your project mean the same thing and nothing says so, your team will use both. So will your agent. You will end up with a `Team` class and a `Group` table, a `submitReport` endpoint and a `war_entry` record, and every one of those pairs is a bug waiting for the week you try to join them._

_An agent cannot resolve this on its own. Asked to add a feature, it reads what is in the repository and imitates it. If the repository is inconsistent it will faithfully reproduce the inconsistency, and it will invent a plausible synonym for anything the repository never names. A glossary in the repository is the only thing that stops it, because the repository is the whole of the agent's memory of your project._

_The other half is human. When your client says "cycle" in one sentence and "sprint" in the next, that is your signal to ask which one they mean, in the meeting, while they are in front of you. An agent reading the transcript later cannot ask._

## The entries that earn their place

_[The temptation is to define words your teammates already know. Skip those. The entries worth writing are:]_

- _**Terms two stakeholders use differently.** The highest-value entry in any glossary. In airline statistics, the International Civil Aviation Organization says **city-pair** and the International Air Transport Association says **O and D**, for the same thing; the two bodies also say **traffic by flight stage** and **segment traffic** for another. A team that misses this builds a report that silently mixes them._
- _**Terms that sound generic but are not.** "Active", "submitted", "complete", "week". Ask what makes a record active and you often find a business rule nobody had stated._
- _**The client's acronyms**, spelled out, including the ones they use so fluently they have forgotten they are acronyms._
- _**Terms you invented** that the client does not use. Record them, then consider dropping them in favor of the client's word._

_Ask the client directly: "Is there a word your team uses here that I would not guess the meaning of?"_

## Conventions

_[The **term itself is the identifier**. There is no separate numbering scheme, because a glossary entry already has a unique, meaningful name: the word. Cite a term by writing it, and keep the spelling identical everywhere it appears._

_Rules:_

- _One entry per concept. If two words mean the same thing, pick one, define it, and list the other as a synonym under it rather than giving it its own entry._
- _Alphabetical order, so a reader can find a term without searching._
- _Define the concept, not the implementation. "A weekly record of what a student did" is a definition; "a row in the `war` table" is not._
- _Use the client's word when the client has one. You are joining their world, not renaming it._
- _If a term has a meaning outside this project that differs from the one here, say so explicitly.]_

## Definitions

_[One `###` heading per term, alphabetical. Follow the heading with a definition of one to three sentences. Add **Synonyms**, **Not to be confused with**, or **Source** lines where they help. Where a term only makes sense with an example, give one._

_Worked examples of the format:_

### Active Week

_A week in which the course is in session and submissions are open. A student can submit a weekly activity report only during an active week, which makes this term the subject of a business rule rather than a piece of trivia._

_**Not to be confused with:** the current calendar week, which continues during breaks when no week is active._

### City-Pair

_The origin and destination airports of a passenger journey, treated as an unordered pair. Used in International Civil Aviation Organization statistics._

_**Synonyms:** O and D (the International Air Transport Association's term for the same concept). Both appear in source data, so any report that combines the two sources has to normalize them first._

### Weekly Activity Report

_A record of what one student did for their team during one week, submitted once per week by that student._

_**Synonyms:** WAR, used conversationally by the client and in the existing spreadsheets. Spell it out on first use in any document._

_**Source:** the client's existing Google Sheets process, described in [vision-and-scope.md](vision-and-scope.md) section 1.2._
